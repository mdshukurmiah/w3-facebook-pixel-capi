## Description

The Facebook Pixel Server-Side Tracking (CAPI) plugin enables you to send Facebook Pixel events directly from your WordPress server to Meta using the Conversions API. This provides more reliable tracking compared to browser-based tracking, especially in an era of increasing privacy restrictions and ad blockers.

### Key Features

- **Server-Side Tracking**: Send events directly from your server to Facebook, bypassing browser limitations
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Automatic tracking of e-commerce events (AddToCart, Purchase, InitiateCheckout)
- **Event Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate events when using both client-side and server-side tracking
- **Privacy Compliant**: Automatically hash sensitive customer data before sending to Facebook
- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration through WordPress admin interface
- **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and development
- **Test Connection**: Built-in tool to verify your Conversions API setup

### Supported Events

- `PageView` – Track page visits  
- `ViewContent` – Track product page views (WooCommerce)  
- `AddToCart` – Track when products are added to cart (WooCommerce)  
- `InitiateCheckout` – Track checkout initiation (WooCommerce)  
- `Purchase` – Track completed orders (WooCommerce)

### Why Use Server-Side Tracking?

- **Improved Data Quality**: Not affected by ad blockers or browser restrictions
- **Better Attribution**: More accurate Facebook Ads conversion data
- **Privacy Compliant**: Customer data is hashed before transmission
- **Reliable Tracking**: Events are sent even when JS fails or doesn’t load
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for a cookieless future
